- add modsg
- write tests
- add pep8 and pylint checks
- add integration with circleCI/whatever
- allow specifying 'name' for vm
- rmvm: 1. by id. 2. by name (regex)
- rmvm allow multiple IDs
- rmvm and stpvm: if the VM is already stopped, command throws an error
- 'are you sure' to all 'rm' commands

Future improvements
- take env var AWS_PROFILE for different profile than default
- lssg -a to show security group description also
- Use cached security groups and cached keypair names in mkvm
- truncate vm name if more than 20 chars logs, with '[...]'
- use echo() instead of print()
- pretty-print flavor names
- use a decorator to get connection object
- printing flavor names should print properly based on width of screen, in a tabular format
- accept --profile parameter, and also show profile information after each command

Validations/bugs
- if rmkp is provided with a name with which no keypair exists, it still says 'keypair deleted'
- keypair input not validated in mkvm
- according to http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html, using input() is unsafe
- update docstrings for all methods
